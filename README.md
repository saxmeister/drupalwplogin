# drupalwplogin
A drop-in Wordpress style login replacement for Drupal 8. No additional code or images required.

Normally modifying the login templates for Drupal 8 requires either a module or custom theme work. This is set up as a very simple and very inelegant drop-in replacement for Drupal 8's standard login page.

No additional coding, CSS, or supporting files are necessary to make this work. All you need to do is download the file and then drop it in your theme's templates directory. The one image used is pulled directly from Drupal.org so you may want to pull a copy of that to reference locally. The CSS is inline and should normally be in its own file and referenced in Drupal's theme.

In the future, I may turn this into a simple module, but this works as a simple drop-in for those who want something super easy.

The included image (wpstyle-drupal-login.png) is here for visual reference.
